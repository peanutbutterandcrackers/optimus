# optimus
A Python module to compute prime numbers and factors (like there isn't enough of it already)

>>> import optimus
>>> optimus.genprimesupto(number) # generates primes upto number and saves it in a hint file named 'primes_hint'
>>> optimus.primefactorsof(numbers) # returns a list of the prime factors of the number

The 'primes_hint' file contains primes upto 1.5 million and should be helpful for anyone using this module to solve
school assignments. Not sure if this would be the best program to try to break the world records with.
